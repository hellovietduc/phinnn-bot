# phinnn-bot

My Telegram Bot called Phinnn.

*Wanna get yourself one too? Follow the guide below.* ‚è¨

## Prerequisites

- It is recommended to deploy this project where you can give it a public URL with a signed certificate, because Telegram Bot Webhook requires `https` to work.
- Make sure you have installed [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) on your [virtual] machine.
- Create you own Telegram Bot [here](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather), you'll get a soulless Bot for now.

## Deploy the Bot's brain

- First, clone the project and install dependencies.

    ```console
    git clone https://github.com/vietduc01100001/phinnn-bot.git
    cd phinnn-bot
    npm install --production
    ```

- Run [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/docs/) via Docker Compose. Feel free to edit [db/docker-compose.yml](db/docker-compose.yml) to match your need (e.g. data persistence).

    ```console
    npm run prisma
    ```

- Set these environment variables.

    ```
    PORT=<the port to listen on>
    TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=<your Telegram Bot token>
    ```

- Run the Bot.

    ```console
    npm start
    ```

    Body: {
